# Clean Code for ABAP

Having a code base, which is readable, testable and maintainable is essential for sustainable development. The book Clean Code from Robert C. Martin and some other books contain many best practices around maintainable code.
Based on these books a style guide has been created for ABAP. 

Make yourself familiar with Clean ABAP by studying the GitHub page and/or the book.

There are several books, which cover the topic in detail, explain the reasoning and apply Clean Code principles to ABAP.

- [Clean ABAP - German Version](https://www.rheinwerk-verlag.de/clean-abap-lesbarer-und-wartbarer-abap-code/)

The books are also very well suited for beginners or starters to learn the programming languages. Or colleagues who already mastered Clean SAPUI5 and want to learn Clean ABAP. And even experts in the programming language mentioned that they learned a lot and it was a source of inspiration.
