# Fix a small bug with the mentor

- The goal is to start getting the new software engineer familiar with the code base. 
- And to increase the confidence of the new software engineer im making changes.
- Making changes early is simply the best way to bring people up to speed and make sure they are comfortable deploying and delivering working software.
- A good safety net of automated tests and a proper usage of the version control system (e.g. Git) can help to increase the confidence even further. If a change breaks a system tests in the test system, just revert the change and redeploy. Then write a unit test so the issue never comes up again.
